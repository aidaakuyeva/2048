/**********************************************************************
 *  List all the files in project.zip and explain their purpose.
 **********************************************************************/
 Cell.java - creates an object Cell with a certain number
 Board.java - creates an object Board that stores a 2d Cell[][] array;
 this program is in charge of merging and randomly generating a new cell
 (it contains most of the functions).
 Draw.java - front end class that draws the cells and the board.
 TwentyFourtyEight.java - the main function where I create a 
 board object and call certain functions based on which key was pressed.
 It also keeps track of the number of movements and outputs when the 
 game was lost or won.





 



 
/**********************************************************************

    Understanding what to start with because there are a lot of functions
    that are based on each other.
